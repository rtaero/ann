Project on predicting customer churn (using Kaggle data) 

In this project we have a dataset of 10K+ banking customers. We know whether they are still with the bank or have churned (i.e. left as customers) 

We use a Convolutional Neural Network with 128 nodes and 1 layer to get an accuract of ~86% to be able to predict whether the customer would churn or not.
